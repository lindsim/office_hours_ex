How to use this program: 

1. Install Python 2 if it is not already on your computer.  Follow the instructions here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Create a folder.
2. Download the db.py and main.py files. Move them to the folder you created in step 3. 
3. Open main.py with Python.

A prompt should appear. You're now ready to enter data into the database following the commands outlined in the coding challenge instructions. 

Notes: 

A database, called office_hours.db, will be created when the program attempts to access the database and does not find an existing database. This database will be saved in the same folder as the two .py files. 

Error messages will appear if commands or arguments do not follow the coding challenge instructions. 

To exit the program, type "quit" at the prompt.
